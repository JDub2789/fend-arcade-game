# Bugger

## What is this?
Bugger is a clone of the classic arcade game Frogger--but with bugs.

It's a lovely summer day, and you want to go for a swim. But some _nasty, giant bugs_ are in the way! Dodge the bugs and make it to the water so you can enjoy some swimming fun.

## How do you play?
The goal is to move your character all the way to the top of the screen. Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move your character.
* up arrow moves you up
* down arrow moves you down
* left arrow moves you left
* right arrow moves you right

Every time you hit the water, you'll gain a point, and the score counter at the top will increase.

## Coming Eventually
* Character selection! Wanna be a girl? A pig? An airplane? Maybe someday you'll be able to.
* Bonus items! Make the game even more challenging by collecting hidden gems before you give in the water.
* More levels? Why not?
